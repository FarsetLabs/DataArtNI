# Getting Data-Art Done

> We're _also_ still scheduling these, so bear with us and join the [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Art-Belfast) for announcements and discussions

Meetups are only part of the puzzle; we need to learn how to handle the different facets of "Data Art", and that takes more than a cursory presentation...

[Farset Labs](https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk) are hosting a series of technical and creative workshops to upskill technologists, creatives, and passionate amateurs in targeted capabilities to enable the acquisition, exploration, augmentation, and visualisation of data in one way or another.

This could (depending on interest displayed) include sessions on topics such as:

- Programming for Data Analysis
- Embedded IoT for sensor acquisition and data visualisation
- Machine Learning and Statistics
- Geospatial Techniques and Analysis
- Real-time Visualisation and Sonification
- Typography and Graphic Design Fundamentals
- Colour Theory and Interactive Visual Arts Design
- 3D Design / Game Development
- Physical Programming (aka Knitting and Crocheting)

But we want to listen to you! And we'll be planning out the workshops with partners based on feedback recieved from the Meetups.
