# Data People + Art People = Magic People

> We're still scheduling these, so bear with us and join the [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Art-Belfast)

Bringing people together to share and discuss their experiments and experiences is key to making structural changes to the world around us. 

Data Art NI is running meetups across Northern Ireland to bring the tech, creative, and public policy sectors together, so share their successes, failures, experiments and experiences, in order to build a shared understanding of how we can make the world, if not a better place, at least a more informed one!

Data Art has been operating as a community-run [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Art-Belfast) since 2017, mostly based in [Farset Labs, Belfast](https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk). 

Thanks to the support of the [Department of Finances OpenDataNI Advocacy fund](https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/open-data-ni-innovation-and-outreach-fund), we want to take the show on the road!

Venues and partners we plan on working with include:

- [Vault Artist Studios, Belfast](https://www.vaultartiststudios.com/)
- [Digital Arts Studios, Belfast](https://digitalartsstudios.com/)
- [Digital Catapult Immersive Labs, Belfast](https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/projects/immersive-labs/)
