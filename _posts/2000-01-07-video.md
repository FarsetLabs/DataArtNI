Being a founding member of [Farset Labs](https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk), a trustee at [Vault Artist Studios](https://www.vaultartiststudios.com/), and a facilitator at [Digital Arts Studios](https://digitalartsstudios.com/), he was able to share some of the "creative collisions" he's come across; from using VR technologies to enable creative expression for disabled  musicians, empowering artists to use electronics to connect their art to the wider world, and using science data to drive policy and political  engagement.
