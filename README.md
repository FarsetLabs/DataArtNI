# Data Art

In 2017 [ODCamp](https://www.odcamp.org.uk/) came to Belfast.

A few months later, a meetup was [started](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Art-Belfast/events/244425732/), and ran sporadically for years out of [Farset Labs](https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk).

A few years later, two applications were made to the [NI Department of Finance OpenDataNI Advocacy Fund](https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/open-data-ni-innovation-and-outreach-fund)

The plan is simple; [Meetups](https://dataartni.net/#meetups) to build community, [Workshops](https://dataartni.net/#workshops) to build skills, [Hackathons](https://dataartni.net/#hackathons) to build solutions

Please help! :sweat_smile:
